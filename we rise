WE RISE BY LIFTING OTHERS


Our soulâ€™s grow, and find happiness, when we give to others. In fact, we are wired to be compassionate and kind. It is a genetic necessity for human survival. The trust, connection and cooperation engendered through giving, creates community, restores the lonely hearts and brings joy.
